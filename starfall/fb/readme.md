Requires the [powerful](https://github.com/its-suun/gmod/tree/master/starfall/lib) library to be installed.

### Commands
  - `?fb`, spawns one football
  - `?puck`, spawns a puck; same controls as football, but larger and you can't shoot in the air
  - `?ent <amount> <model> <force-multiplier>` , use `-` to use the default value for a parameter

I suggest using this football script with [Tek's Football Field](https://github.com/its-suun/gmod/blob/master/expression2/tekFootballField.txt).
